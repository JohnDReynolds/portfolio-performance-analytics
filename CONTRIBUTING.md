# Contributing

This project is maintained as a single upstream open-source repository.

Contributions are welcome, including documentation, tests, examples, and code
improvements.

To ensure the health and consistency of the project, all changes should be
submitted via pull requests against the main repository.

The original author serves as the project maintainer and reviews all proposed
changes. Attribution for contributors will be preserved.

Organizations wishing to invest in improvements are encouraged to collaborate
upstream rather than maintain long-lived private forks.
